    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons olive oil
      </li>
      <li>
        1 medium onion, finely diced
      </li>
      <li>
        1/2 serrano or jalapeno chili, diced
      </li>
      <li>
        1.8 lb / 800 g ground beef (we used 93% meat, 7% fat)
      </li>
      <li>
        5 cloves garlic, diced
      </li>
      <li>
        2 teaspoons salt
      </li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon ground coriander seed
      </li>
      <li>
        2 teaspoons ground cumin
      </li>
      <li>
        2 teaspoons paprika
      </li>
      <li>
        1 teaspoon dried oregano
      </li>
      <li>
        2/3 cup water
      </li>
      <li>
        1 cup chopped tinned tomatoes, passata
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>Step 1</p>
    <p>
      Turn the Instant Pot on and press the Saute function key. Add the olive oil, onions and chili and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring a few times, until softened and golden brown.
    </p>
  
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <p>
      Add the beef and garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring and breaking the clumps of ground beef with a spatula.
    </p>

    <p>Step 3</p>
    <p>
      Add the water and stir through the beef, making sure to scrape the bits off the bottom. Water will help to deglaze the bottom and anything that might be stuck, which will prevent the possibility of BURN error.
    </p>
    <p>Step 4</p>
    <p>
      Press Cancel to stop the Saute process. Add the tomato sauce on top and spread it evenly with a spoon. DO NOT stir the sauce into the meat but rather layer it. Sometimes, the new models of IP can be very sensitive to burning high-sugar ingredients such as tomato sauces, so for this recipe, it’s best to leave it at the top of the meat.
    </p>
    <p>Step 5</p>
    <p>
      Set to Manual/Pressure Cook on HIGH pressure for 10 minutes. After 3 beeps, the Instant Pot will start to build up the pressure. This will take about 5-10 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>Step 6</p>
    <p>
      Once the timer goes off, allow 5-10 minutes for natural pressure release and then point the top valve to Venting to do a quick release. Open the lid and stir the sauce through. At this stage, it will have a lot of liquid from the meat juices, so we will use the Saute function again to thicken the sauce.
    </p>

    <p>Step 7</p>
    <p>
      Press the Saute and cook the beef for 7-10 minutes, stirring frequently. This will allow the liquid to evaporate and the sauce to thicken to you preferred consistency.  
    </p>

    <p>Step 8</p>
    <p>
      Cool down before storing in the fridge or freezer.
